# Netikras' blog

Here I'll be ranting away about things I come across - things that you might come across as well. And since I'm already walking that path I might as well give you all a heads-up what's there. Also it's nice to have a sole place for all the notes - a place I can look at myself some day if I need to.

This should be a more tech-related blog, but there might be some off-topic posts as well.
